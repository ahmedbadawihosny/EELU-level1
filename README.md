Core math
Discrete math (Math for CS) is a prerequisite and closely related to the study of algorithms and data structures. Calculus both prepares students for discrete math and helps students develop mathematical maturity.

**Topics covered**:
`discrete mathematics`
`mathematical proofs`
`basic statistics`
`O-notation`
`discrete probability`
`and more`

## Maths Courses ðŸ“–

I'm a fan in math, so I took many maths courses which CS students are not obligated to take. So feel free to take the ones you like !

### 1. Basics ðŸŒ±

---

#### 1.1 Calculus and Linear Algebra 

| Course Link                                                  | Difficulty |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [MIT18.01: Single variable calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/syllabus/) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ         |
| [MIT18.02: Multi variable calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |
| [MIT18.06: Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/syllabus/) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |

Think you have already been expert in these three courses ? Trust me, spend some time reading the course notes, it will deepen your understanding !



#### 1.2 Basics of Information theory

| Course Link                                                  | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [MIT6.050J: Information theory and Entropy](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-050j-information-and-entropy-spring-2008/index.htm) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ         |

This course is designed for freshman in MIT. I strongly recommend you to take it to understand some basic concepts in information theory.

### 2. Intermediate ðŸ˜Š

---

#### 2.1 Probability theory

| Course Link                                                  | My repository                                         | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [UCB CS70 : discrete Math and probility theory](http://www.eecs70.org) | [Completed](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/UCB-CS70) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |
| [MIT6.431: Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/index.htm) |                                                       | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ       |
| [UCB CS126 : Probility theory](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee126/fa20/content.html) | [Ongoing](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/EECS126)    | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ      |

I took these three courses about probility theory. The UCB CS126 has some really interesting labs where you can write code in python to solve some practical probability problems. I suggest you take the first two to enhance your theoretical basis then take the last one just for fun !

#### 2.2 Differential equations

| Course Link                                                  | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [MIT18.03: differential equations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/unit-i-first-order-differential-equations/) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |
| [MIT18.04: Complex variables functions](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-04-complex-variables-with-applications-spring-2018/) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |
| [MIT18.152: Partial differential equations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-152-introduction-to-partial-differential-equations-fall-2011/index.htm) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ       |

MIT18.03 focuses on constant differential equations. To solve more interesting dynamic systems, we need to learn partial differential equations. Since PDE requires that you should know about complex variable functions, read the notes of MIT18.04 first !

#### 2.3 Numerical thinking

You may feel tired to learn theoretical math (come on, isn't it exciting ?)

Don't worry, you can use computer to do the math for you. Many MIT maths courses use Julia language to help you understand maths concepts and deal with the maths problems in real life !

| Course Link                                                  | My repository                                        | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [MIT18.S191: Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/) | TBA                                                  | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ         |
| [MIT18.330 : Introduction to numerical analysis](https://github.com/mitmath/18330) | [Ongoing](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/MIT18.330) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ        |
| [MIT18.335 : Introduction to numerical method](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-spring-2019/index.htm) | TBA                                                  | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ       |

In the first course, you will master julia and do some basic but interesting labs, e.g. image processing, ray tracing, climate simulation and so on !

Then you can use julia to do the numerical analysis ! (a sad story: there are also many theoretical contents ~)

If you find 18.330 a little bit easy, you can take the graduate-level course : MIT18.335.

### 3. Advanced ðŸ¤¯

| Course Link                                                  | My repository                                                | Difficulty |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| [MIT18.650: Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-443-statistics-for-applications-spring-2015/index.htm) |                                                              | Unknown    |
| [MIT18.781: Theory of Numbers](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-781-theory-of-numbers-spring-2012/index.htm) |                                                              | Unknown    |
| [MIT6.441: Information Theory](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-441-information-theory-spring-2016/syllabus/) |                                                              | Unknown    |
| [Standford EE364A: Convex Optimization](http://stanford.edu/class/ee364a/index.html) | [Completed](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/Standford_CVX101) | ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ       |
| [Standford CS255: Cryptography](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cs255/) |                                                              | Unknown    |

All the courses above are graduate-level and I haven't taken all of them. I may dive into some of them when I need. However, I personally recommend the Convex Optimization course.
